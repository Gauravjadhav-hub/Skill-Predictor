Skill Assessment Application
Overview
The Skill Assessment Application is a Flask-based web application designed to help users identify suitable job roles based on their skill levels in various programming and technical areas. It utilizes a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to recommend job roles based on user inputs.

Features
User Input: Users can select their skill levels in different programming languages and technologies.
Job Recommendations: The application provides suitable job roles based on the user's skill levels.
Data Visualization: The application displays the distribution of skill levels among different programming languages.
Responsive Design: The application is built with user-friendly HTML templates.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Flask
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn

File Structure
app.py: The main application file that contains all the routes and logic.
templates/: Directory containing HTML templates:
index.html: Main input page for users to enter their skill levels.
result.html: Page that displays the job recommendations and skill distribution.
base.html: Base template for consistent layout across pages.
explore.html: Additional page for exploring features or content.
How It Works
Users enter their skill levels (Beginner, Moderate, Advanced) for various programming languages and technologies.
The application processes the input and counts the number of skills in each category.
Based on the counts, it recommends suitable job roles using a trained KNN model.
